This is the project of ETL process and data analysis regarding clothing orders from global brands.
The project was based on the use of the Databricks environment, where I used the PySpark library in Python and also used SQL, all integrated in one notebook. 
This multi-tasking approach allowed me to effectively process and analyze data from various perspectives.
The data used in the project can be found in the attached json files.
